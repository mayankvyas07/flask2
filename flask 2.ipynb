    "Q1. GET and POST Methods:\n",
    "In the context of web applications and APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "GET: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource. It sends data as query parameters in the URL and is typically used to retrieve data. GET requests are idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.\n",
    "POST: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource. It sends data in the body of the request and is often used to create or update resources on the server. POST requests are not idempotent, as multiple identical requests might have different outcomes.\n",
    "Q2. request in Flask:\n",
    "The request object in Flask allows you to access incoming request data, such as form data, URL parameters, and headers. It's an important tool for handling and processing data sent by the client to the server. By using the request object, you can access data from both GET and POST requests, making it essential for building interactive web applications and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. redirect() in Flask:\n",
    "The redirect() function in Flask is used to redirect the client to a different URL. This is often used after processing a form submission or after performing some action on the server that requires a different page to be displayed. It helps maintain proper user flow by directing them to the appropriate page after completing a certain action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Templates in Flask and render_template():\n",
    "In Flask, templates are used to generate dynamic HTML content that is sent to the client's browser. Templates allow you to separate the presentation layer from your application logic. The render_template() function is used to render HTML templates and pass dynamic data to them. It uses Jinja2, a powerful templating engine, to process template files and fill in placeholders with actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Creating a Simple API:\n",
    "Here's a simple example of creating an API using Flask that returns a JSON response. You can use Postman to test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "from flask import Flask, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "def hello():\n",
    "    data = {'message': 'Hello, this is a simple API!'}\n",
    "    return jsonify(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run()\n",
    "To test this API using Postman:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Postman.\n",
    "Create a new request with the request type set to GET.\n",
    "Enter the URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/hello.\n",
    "Click the \"Send\" button.\n",
    "You should see the JSON response in the \"Response\" section of Postman"
